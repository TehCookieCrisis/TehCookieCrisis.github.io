    "concept": "The Drug Mule",
    "conceptDescription": "Brie is a party girl, a slut, an idiot, a drug addict, a Valley girl and one of the few souls in the West who can brew an incredibly potent potion that can confer the power of Disciplines without ever learning them. <i>Sadhana</i> is an old Indian form of blood magic and is jealously guarded by the bloodlines in Southeast Asia. Older and in some ways more versatile than a Tremere's Thaumaturgy, there is a catch - it is only effective if the caster does not take monetary compensation for his craft. And this Brianna was embraced.</br>Brianna was created to brew the potions so that her Sire may profit off of her labor. She doesn't really see it that way, mostly because she is somewhat lacking in the brains department, but she is also just a simple woman with simple desires; and her Sire is just very good at giving her what she wants: The freedom to live life as a neverending party and all the drugs she could possibly desire.",
    "name": "Brianna \"Brie\" Danielle Wydman",
    "nameDescription": "They thought Brian Daniel was going to be boy - however a crying baby girl was put into the arms of the Wydmans shortly after birth and they didn't really feel like changing the name they had already picked out.",
    "clan": "<s>Daitya</s> Malkavian",
    "clanDescription": "Brianna? Embraced into a rare Setite Bloodline? That has a strong belief in the Indian caste system and rarely if ever embraces outside of it?</br>Rumors only! Never would her Sire have made a vampire that would land him a Final Death sentence as soon as they are found out! <b class=\"bold\">Never!</b> And now stop asking questions, this is clearly a Malkavian!"
